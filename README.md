# macos-defaults

A tool for managing macOS defaults declaratively via YAML files.

## Install

### Homebrew

```shell
brew install dsully/tap/macos-defaults
```

### Source

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/dsully/macos-defaults
```

## Usage

### Dump a defaults domain to YAML

```shell
# To stdout:
macos-defaults dump -d com.apple.Dock

# To a file:
macos-defaults dump -d com.apple.Dock dock.yaml

# Global domain
macos-defaults dump -g
```

### Apply defaults from a YAML file

```shell
# From a single YAML file:
macos-defaults apply dock.yaml

# From a directory with YAML files & debug logging:
macos-defaults apply -vvv ~/.config/macos-defaults/
```

### Generate shell completions

```shell
macos-defaults completions [bash|fish|zsh] > ~/.config/fish/completions/macos-defaults.fish
```

See `macos-defaults --help` for more details.

## YAML Format

```yaml
---
# This will be printed to stdout.
description: Contacts

# Use the currentHost hardware UUID to find the correct plist file.
# https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/353528/what-is-currenthost-for-in-defaults
current_host: false

# Send a SIGTERM to one or more processes if any defaults were changed.
kill: ["Contacts", "cfprefsd"]

# A nested map of plist domains to key/value pairs to set.
data:
  # Show first name
  # 1 = before last name
  # 2 = after last name
  NSGlobalDomain:
    NSPersonNameDefaultDisplayNameOrder: 1

  # Sort by
  com.apple.AddressBook:
    ABNameSortingFormat: "sortingFirstName sortingLastName"

    # vCard format
    # false = 3.0
    # true = 2.1
    ABUse21vCardFormat: false

    # Enable private me vCard
    ABPrivateVCardFieldsEnabled: false

    # Export notes in vCards
    ABIncludeNotesInVCard: true

    # Export photos in vCards
    ABIncludePhotosInVCard: true
```

You may also use full paths to `.plist` files instead of domain names.

This is the only way to set values in /Library/Preferences/

### Dictionary merge syntax

If a dictionary property contains the key `...`, it will be merged with the previous value of that dictionary. Keys before the `...` take precendece, then the old keys, then keys after it.

For example, the following config:
```yaml
data:
  com.apple.finder:
    DesktopViewSettings:
      IconViewSettings:
        labelOnBottom: false # item info on right
        ...: {}
        iconSize: 80.0

```
Will perform the following actions:
* Set `DesktopViewSettings:IconViewSettings:labelOnBottom` to true,
* Set `DesktopViewSettings:IconViewSettings:iconSize` to 80.0, but only if it doesn't already exist.  
* Keep all other keys on `IconViewSettings` as-is.

If `...` isn't present, the dictionary will be fully overwritten, and keys not specified will be deleted.

### Array merge syntax

If an array contains the element `"..."`, it will be replaced by the contents of the existing array. Arrays are treated like sets, so elements which already exist will not be added.

For example, the following config:

```yaml
data:
  org.my.test:
    aDict:
    };
        anArray: ["foo", "...", "bar"]
```

* Prepend `"foo"` to `aDict:anArray`, if it doesn't already contain `"foo"`.
* AppendÂ `"bar"` to `aDict:anArray`, if it doesn't already contain `"bar"`.

## On YAML

![Yelling At My Laptop](docs/YAML.jpg?raw=true)

[YAML](https://yaml.org) is not a format I prefer, but out of common formats it unfortunately had the most properties I wanted.

* [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) doesn't have comments and is overly verbose (JSONC/JSON5 is not common)

* [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML): No.

* [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) is too limited.

* [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) is overly verbose and is surprisingly not that easy to work with in Rust. Deeply nested maps are poorly handled.

* [KDL](https://kdl.dev) is nice, but document oriented & needs struct annotations. Derive is implemented in the 3rd party [Knuffle](https://docs.rs/knuffel/latest/knuffel/) crate.

* [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) is Rust specific, so editor support isn't there.

* [KCL](https://kcl-lang.io), [CUE](https://cuelang.org), [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl), too high level & not appropriate for the task.

So YAML it is.
